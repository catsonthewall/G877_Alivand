# G877_Alivand

I guess we need a plan on what needs to be done...
This is a draft (proposal)...

1. Find hiking paths vector data (Annika, already done)
2. Transform this data into a network (Baoyu, Jing)
4. Create a Dijkstras Algorithm for shortest distance, with some dummy data for testing (Annika)
5. Calculate a variable (for example viewshed...), that determines the scenicness (Fabio, Dominik)
6. Create a Dijkstras with the scenicness as weights (to do later)
7. Choose some sample points to calculate our routes (to do later)
=> Compare these routes (to do later)
