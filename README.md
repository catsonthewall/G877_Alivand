I guess we need a plan on what needs to be done...
This is a draft (proposal)...

1. Find hiking paths vector data
2. Transform this data into a network
3. Create a Dijkstras Algorithm for shortest distance
4. Calculate a variable (for example viewshed...), that determines the scenicness
5. Create a Dijkstras with the scenicness as weights
6. Choose some sample points to calculate our routes
=> Compare these routes
