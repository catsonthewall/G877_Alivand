I guess we need a plan on what needs to be done...
This is a draft (proposal)...

1. Find hiking paths vector data (Annika, already done)
2. Transform this data into a network (Baoyu, Jing, done)
4. Create a Dijkstras Algorithm for shortest distance, with some dummy data for testing (Annika)
5. Calculate a variable (for example viewshed...), that determines the scenicness (Fabio, Dominik) **ANNOUNCEMENT**: the analysis for the scenicness through landcover is theoretically finished (see visibility analysis.ipynb).
6. Create a Dijkstras with the scenicness as weights (to do later)
7. Choose some sample points to calculate our routes (to do later)
=> Compare these routes (to do later)

Network usage instructions:
In the process of creating the graph, we utilize three methods: adjacency list, edge list, and adjacent matrix. As Ross mentioned, if we have additional time later, we can conduct experiments to test these different methods, which will serve as a significant milestone for us. Now, you can choose one method you prefer.
